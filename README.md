# LoanFit-Eligibility-Check
A machine learning project to predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for loan approval based on factors like income, credit history, employment, and loan amount. This project covers data cleaning, EDA, model training, evaluation, and final prediction.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **train_projU.csv**: Training dataset (historical data with outcomes)
- **test_projU.csv**: Test dataset (new applicants where predictions are required)

## ðŸ”— Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Prediction on applicants using best-performing model

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Best Model
**Random Forest** provided the highest accuracy and was selected for final predictions.
